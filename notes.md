# part 1 summary:

    - Just an introduction to serializers and django's httpResponse and JsonResponse.
    - Keep in mind to compare this to part 2 as part 2 has a custom view from the Django Rest Framework.
    - Also looking like I may want to use HttpResponse or JsonResponse for a simple return as it has just the content information.
        - However, I may want to return header information and such and in that case HttpResponse or JsonResponse may not suffice.

# part 2 summary:

    - The Response object allows us to specify the content-type resulting in more flexible return types.
        - This also returns header information rather than just the content body.
